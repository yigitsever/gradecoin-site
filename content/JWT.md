> JSON Web Tokens are representations of claims, or authorization proofs that fit into the `Header` of HTTP requests.

# How?
JWTs are used as the [MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code) of operations that require authorization.
Gradecoin has 2 such operations:
- block proposal
- transaction proposal.

They are sent alongside the JSON request body in the `Header`;

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token here>
```

Gradecoin uses 3 fields for the JWTs;

```json
{
"tha": "Hash of the payload, check invididual references",
"iat": "Issued At, Unix Time",
"exp": "Expiration Time, epoch"
}
```

- `tha` is explained in [blocks](@/block_docs.md) and [transactions](@/transaction_docs.md) documentations.
- `iat` when the JWT was created in [Unix Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) format.
- `exp` when the JWT will expire & be rejected in [Unix Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

# Algorithm
We are using [RS256](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518.html#section-3.1), `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256`.
The JWTs you encode with your private RSA key will be decoded using the public key you have authenticated with.
You can see how the process works and create ad hoc tokens [here](https://jwt.io/).
